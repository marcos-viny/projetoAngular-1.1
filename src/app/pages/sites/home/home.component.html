        Shut up! Will you shut up?! Bring her forward! What a strange person. I'm not a witch. Where'd you get the coconuts? Well, how'd you become king, then? Why do you think that she is a witch? …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? I don't want to talk
        t you! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Look, my liege! Shut up! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive
        power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. I have to push the pram a lot. I'm not a witch. But you are dressed as one… Camelot! Bloody Peasant! Well, I didn't vote for you. Well, she turned me into a
        newt. She looks like one. Shut up! Will you shut up?! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Did you dress her up like this? We found them. Oh, ow! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. She looks like one. Who's that then? The
        swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. It's only a model. I'm not a witch. Look, my liege! We want a shrubbery!! The swallow may fly south
        with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. You don't vote for kings. Who's that then? Who's that then? Why do you think that she is a witch? Well, Mercia's a temperate
        zone! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! How do you know she is a witch? Did you dress her up like this? Be quiet! Bring her forward! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes
        in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic
        ceremony. Camelot! Well, what do you want? Well, I got better. You don't vote for kings. Why do you think that she is a witch? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called
        Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Well, I didn't vote for you. We want a shrubbery!! But you are dressed as one… Burn her anyway! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. He hasn't got
        shit all over him. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
